The **Game & Watch** brand is a series of handheld electronic games developed, manufactured, released and marketed by Nintendo from 1980 to 1991. Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi, the product derived its name from its featuring a single game as well as a clock on an LCD screen. The series sold a combined 43.4 million units worldwide, and was the earliest Nintendo video game product to gain major success.

**Ball** is a Game & Watch game released as a part of the Silver series on April 28, 1980. It was the first Game & Watch game. It is a single-screen single-player Game & Watch.

In Game A, the player tosses two balls in the air. As the balls fall, the player must catch and toss them up again. One point is earned for each successful catch. A dropped ball will display a broken ball and end the game. The object is to continuously catch the balls that fall and throw them back up, as in juggling. In Game B, the player must juggle three balls, and each successful catch rewards ten points instead of one.
